# Rust RTS

A real-time strategy game that runs on a server and streams game state to a client.

## Getting Started

If you have rust + cargo installed.

```
cd ../rust_rts
cargo run --release

Enter your IP address
localhost

Enter port number
4444
```

This will get a server up and running on localhost:4444

You should then use https://zacharykamerling.github.io/  to connect as a player to the server.
